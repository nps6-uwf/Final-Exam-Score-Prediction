# Final-Exam-Score-Prediction
Using multivariate regression to predict M52 student final exams.

My 17 year old (M52) high school computer science students are assesed with a midterm and 4 formative assignments.  I use the average of the 4 formative scores and the midterm grade for each student in conjunction with multivariate regression in an attempt to predict the students final exam grade.

The csv data format:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>class #</td>
    <td>id #</td>
    ...
    <td>cname</td>
  </tr>
</table>
