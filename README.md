# Final-Exam-Score-Prediction
Using multivariate regression to predict M52 student final exams.

My 17 year old (M52) high school computer science students are assesed with a midterm and 4 formative assignments.  I use the average of the 4 formative scores and the midterm grade for each student in conjunction with multivariate regression in an attempt to predict the students final exam grade.

The csv data format:
    student #, id, ..., name, stem, midterm, midterm re-test, formative 1 (f1), f2, f3, f4, f5, formative (total), behavior, final, total, grade
